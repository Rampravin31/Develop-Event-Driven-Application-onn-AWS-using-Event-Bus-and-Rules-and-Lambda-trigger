Develop Event Driven Application on AWS using Event Bus and Rules and Lambda trigger:

>> Create a custom event Bus first.
>> Add a rule to create a cutomized event pattern to trigger the targets, which are the lambda function.
>> Add the event pattern on the event pattern area box.
>> Now add the Hello World lambda function as the triggers.
>> When you execute the Trigger code with correct event pattern, the event bus rule will filter the event pattern and triiger the target function.
>> Check the log groups for lambda to verify, the target function will be executed.
